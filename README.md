# poetry

This program will allow the user to type in several
lines of a poem.  The user will signal the end of their
input by typing a single dot (“.”) on a newline.  After
the end of the input stage, the program will tell the
user (output) how many lines and words are in the
poem and how many words are on each line of the
poem.
